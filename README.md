Print Distributor Scripts
=========================

These are some sample script files for the Script action in Print Distributor.

To use the scripts add a Script action to your Print Distributor configuration
and paste in the code.

Further documentation on VBScript is available at <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/t0aew7h6(v=vs.84).aspx>. Most of the scripts use the FileSystemObject
which is documented at <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6kxy1a51(v=vs.84).aspx>.

The print job attributes are available to scripts as well as a number of helper methods. These are all documented in the help file in Print Distributor.
